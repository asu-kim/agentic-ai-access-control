# agentic-ai-access-control

This repository provides the prototype implementation accompanying our case study on access control for Agentic AI in critical tasks.

# Directory structure
---
- **case_study**: Directory for case study experiments. Each subdirectory corresponds to a scenario (Hotel reservation, Product purchase, and Banking system) and contains the agent code scripts and log files generated during experiments.
- **proposed_website**: Directory for the prototype website. It provides a web dashboard to define constraints and delegate tasks for Agentic AI. The [README.md](https://github.com/asu-kim/agentic-ai-access-control/blob/main/proposed_website/README.md) provides instructions for building and running the site locally.
